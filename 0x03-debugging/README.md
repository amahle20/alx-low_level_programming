# 0x03. C - Debugging

This repository contains solutions to debugging exercises in the C programming language. The purpose of this project is to practice identifying and fixing bugs in code.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each representing a specific debugging exercise. Within each exercise directory, you will find the following files:

- `main.c`: The main source code file containing the buggy code.
- `holberton.h`: The header file with function prototypes and necessary dependencies.
- `tests`: This directory contains test files used to verify the correctness of the fixed code.
- `README.md`: Additional information and instructions for each exercise.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code in this repository, you need the following:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or a compatible C compiler
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)

## Usage

To debug and fix the code in each exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x03-debugging.git
   ```

2. Change to the exercise directory you want to work on:

   ```
   cd 0x03-debugging/exercise-directory
   ```

3. Open the `main.c` file in a text editor and carefully analyze the code to identify the bugs.

4. Once you have identified the bugs, make the necessary changes to fix them.

5. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command. For example:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c -o program
   ```

6. Run the compiled program to verify that the bugs have been fixed:

   ```
   ./program
   ```
